abstract={Aims: Primary forests are critical for forest biodiversity and provide key ecosystem services. In Europe, these forests are particularly scarce and it is unclear whether they are sufficiently protected. Here we aim to: (a) understand whether extant primary forests are representative of the range of naturally occurring forest types, (b) identify forest types which host enough primary forest under strict protection to meet conservation targets and (c) highlight areas where restoration is needed and feasible. Location: Europe. Methods: We combined a unique geodatabase of primary forests with maps of forest cover, potential natural vegetation, biogeographic regions and protected areas to quantify the proportion of extant primary forest across Europe's forest types and to identify gaps in protection. Using spatial predictions of primary forest locations to account for underreporting of primary forests, we then highlighted areas where restoration could complement protection. Results: We found a substantial bias in primary forest distribution across forest types. Of the 54 forest types we assessed, six had no primary forest at all, and in two-thirds of forest types, less than 1% of forest was primary. Even if generally protected, only ten forest types had more than half of their primary forests strictly protected. Protecting all documented primary forests requires expanding the protected area networks by 1,132 km2 (19,194 km2 when including also predicted primary forests). Encouragingly, large areas of non-primary forest existed inside protected areas for most types, thus presenting restoration opportunities. Main conclusion: Europe's primary forests are in a perilous state, as also acknowledged by EU's “Biodiversity Strategy for 2030.” Yet, there are considerable opportunities for ensuring better protection and restoring primary forest structure, composition and functioning, at least partially. We advocate integrated policy reforms that explicitly account for the irreplaceable nature of primary forests and ramp up protection and restoration efforts alike. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Defining the species pool of a community is crucial for many types of ecological analyses, providing a foundation to metacommunity, null modelling or dark diversity frameworks. It is a challenge to derive the species pool empirically from large and heterogeneous databases. Here, we propose a method to define a site-specific species pool (SSSP), i.e. the probabilistic set of species that may co-occur with the species of a target community. Using large databases with geo-referenced records that comprise full plant community surveys, our approach characterizes each site by its own species pool without requiring a pre-defined habitat classification. We calculate the probabilities of each species in the database to occur in the target community using Beals’ index of sociological favourability, and then build sample-based rarefaction curves from neighbouring records with similar species composition to estimate the asymptotic species pool size. A corresponding number of species is then selected among the species having the highest occurrence probability, thus defining both size and composition of the species pool. We tested the robustness of this approach by comparing SSSPs obtained with different spatial extents and dissimilarity thresholds, fitting different models to the rarefaction curves, and comparing the results obtained when using Beals co-occurrence probabilities or presence/absence data. As an example application, we calculated the SSSPs for all calcareous grassland records in the German Vegetation Reference Database, and show how our method could be used to 1) produce grain-dependent estimations of species richness across plots, 2) derive scalable maps of species richness and 3) define the full list of species composing the SSSP of each target site. By deriving the species pool exclusively from community characteristics, the SSSP framework presented here provides a robust approach to bridge biodiversity estimations across spatial scales. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Aim: To identify functional traits that best predict community assembly without knowing the underlying environmental drivers. Methods: We propose a new method based on the correlation r(XY) between two matrices of potential community composition: the matrix X is fuzzy-weighted by trait similarities of species, and the matrix Y is derived by Beals smoothing using the probabilities of species co-occurrences. Since X is based on one or more traits, r(XY) measures how well the traits used for fuzzy-weighting reflect the species co-occurrence patterns in Y. We developed an optimisation algorithm to identify the traits maximising this correlation, together with an appropriate permutational test for significance. Using metacommunity data generated by a stochastic, individual-based, spatially explicit model, we assessed the type I error and the power of our method across different simulation scenarios, varying environmental filtering parameters, number of traits and trait correlation structures. Then, we applied the method to real-world community and trait data of dry calcareous grassland communities across Germany to identify, out of 49 traits, the combination of traits that maximised r(XY). Results: The method correctly identified the relevant traits involved in the assembly mechanisms of simulated communities, showing high power and accurate type I error. It proved to be robust against confounding aspects related to interactions between environmental factors, strength of limiting factors, and trait collinearity. In the grassland dataset, the method identified five traits that best explained community assembly. These traits reflect the size and the leaf economics spectrum, which are related to succession and resource supply, factors that may not be always measured in real-world situations. Conclusions: Our method successfully identified the relevant traits mediating community assembly, therefore providing insights on the underlying environmental and biotic factors, even if these are hidden, unmeasured or not accessible at the spatial or temporal scale of the study. © 2020 International Association for Vegetation Science},

abstract={Aims: Vegetation-plot records provide information on the presence and cover or abundance of plants co-occurring in the same community. Vegetation-plot data are spread across research groups, environmental agencies and biodiversity research centers and, thus, are rarely accessible at continental or global scales. Here we present the sPlot database, which collates vegetation plots worldwide to allow for the exploration of global patterns in taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity at the plant community level. Results: sPlot version 2.1 contains records from 1,121,244 vegetation plots, which comprise 23,586,216 records of plant species and their relative cover or abundance in plots collected worldwide between 1885 and 2015. We complemented the information for each plot by retrieving climate and soil conditions and the biogeographic context (e.g., biomes) from external sources, and by calculating community-weighted means and variances of traits using gap-filled data from the global plant trait database TRY. Moreover, we created a phylogenetic tree for 50,167 out of the 54,519 species identified in the plots. We present the first maps of global patterns of community richness and community-weighted means of key traits. Conclusions: The availability of vegetation plot data in sPlot offers new avenues for vegetation analysis at the global scale. © 2019 International Association for Vegetation Science},

abstract={Policies to mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss often assume that protecting carbon-rich forests provides co-benefits in terms of biodiversity, due to the spatial congruence of carbon stocks and biodiversity at biogeographic scales. However, it remains unclear whether this holds at the scales relevant for management, and particularly large knowledge gaps exist for temperate forests and for taxa other than trees. We built a comprehensive dataset of Central European temperate forest structure and multi-taxonomic diversity (beetles, birds, bryophytes, fungi, lichens, and plants) across 352 plots. We used Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs) to assess the relationship between above-ground live carbon stocks and (a) taxon-specific richness, (b) a unified multidiversity index. We used Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis to explore individual species’ responses to changing above-ground carbon stocks and to detect change-points in species composition along the carbon-stock gradient. Our results reveal an overall weak and highly variable relationship between richness and carbon stock at the stand scale, both for individual taxonomic groups and for multidiversity. Similarly, the proportion of win-win and trade-off species (i.e., species favored or disadvantaged by increasing carbon stock, respectively) varied substantially across taxa. Win-win species gradually replaced trade-off species with increasing carbon, without clear thresholds along the above-ground carbon gradient, suggesting that community-level surrogates (e.g., richness) might fail to detect critical changes in biodiversity. Collectively, our analyses highlight that leveraging co-benefits between carbon and biodiversity in temperate forest may require stand-scale management that prioritizes either biodiversity or carbon in order to maximize co-benefits at broader scales. Importantly, this contrasts with tropical forests, where climate and biodiversity objectives can be integrated at the stand scale, thus highlighting the need for context-specificity when managing for multiple objectives. Accounting for critical change-points of target taxa can help to deal with this specificity, by defining a safe operating space to manipulate carbon while avoiding biodiversity losses. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Plant functional traits directly affect ecosystem functions. At the species level, trait combinations depend on trade-offs representing different ecological strategies, but at the community level trait combinations are expected to be decoupled from these trade-offs because different strategies can facilitate co-existence within communities. A key question is to what extent community-level trait composition is globally filtered and how well it is related to global versus local environmental drivers. Here, we perform a global, plot-level analysis of trait–environment relationships, using a database with more than 1.1 million vegetation plots and 26,632 plant species with trait information. Although we found a strong filtering of 17 functional traits, similar climate and soil conditions support communities differing greatly in mean trait values. The two main community trait axes that capture half of the global trait variation (plant stature and resource acquisitiveness) reflect the trade-offs at the species level but are weakly associated with climate and soil conditions at the global scale. Similarly, within-plot trait variation does not vary systematically with macro-environment. Our results indicate that, at fine spatial grain, macro-environmental drivers are much less important for functional trait composition than has been assumed from floristic analyses restricted to co-occurrence in large grid cells. Instead, trait combinations seem to be predominantly filtered by local-scale factors such as disturbance, fine-scale soil conditions, niche partitioning and biotic interactions. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={Aim: Primary forests have high conservation value but are rare in Europe due to historic land use. Yet many primary forest patches remain unmapped, and it is unclear to what extent they are effectively protected. Our aim was to (1) compile the most comprehensive European-scale map of currently known primary forests, (2) analyse the spatial determinants characterizing their location and (3) locate areas where so far unmapped primary forests likely occur. Location: Europe. Methods: We aggregated data from a literature review, online questionnaires and 32 datasets of primary forests. We used boosted regression trees to explore which biophysical, socio-economic and forest-related variables explain the current distribution of primary forests. Finally, we predicted and mapped the relative likelihood of primary forest occurrence at a 1-km resolution across Europe. Results: Data on primary forests were frequently incomplete or inconsistent among countries. Known primary forests covered 1.4 Mha in 32 countries (0.7% of Europe’s forest area). Most of these forests were protected (89%), but only 46% of them strictly. Primary forests mostly occurred in mountain and boreal areas and were unevenly distributed across countries, biogeographical regions and forest types. Unmapped primary forests likely occur in the least accessible and populated areas, where forests cover a greater share of land, but wood demand historically has been low. Main conclusions: Despite their outstanding conservation value, primary forests are rare and their current distribution is the result of centuries of land use and forest management. The conservation outlook for primary forests is uncertain as many are not strictly protected and most are small and fragmented, making them prone to extinction debt and human disturbance. Predicting where unmapped primary forests likely occur could guide conservation efforts, especially in Eastern Europe where large areas of primary forest still exist but are being lost at an alarming pace. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Aim: Biodiversity monitoring and conservation are extremely complex, and surrogate taxa may represent proxies to test methods and solutions. However, cross-taxon correlations in species diversity (i.e., cross-taxon congruence) may vary widely with spatial scale. Our goal is to assess how cross-taxon congruence varies with spatial scale in European temperate forests. We expect that congruence in species diversity increases when shifting from fine to coarse spatial scales, with differences between species richness and composition, and across pairs of taxonomic groups. Location: European temperate forests. Time period: Present. Major taxa studied: Vascular plants, bryophytes, birds, epiphytic lichens, saproxylic beetles and wood-inhabiting fungi. Methods: We used field data (354 plots across 23 sites) encompassing Italy, France and Hungary, with species information for six taxonomic groups. We accounted separately for spatial grain (the size of elementary sampling unit) and extent (the geographical area included in the survey) and evaluated the relationships within all the possible pairs of taxa. Results: Although no pair of taxa had its species richness consistently correlated across scales, we found no changes in the direction of correlations when analysing species composition. However, when increasing grain and extent, we did find a general increase in the magnitude of correlations in species composition and partial changes in significance, with plants having the highest number of significant correlations. Main conclusions: Species richness congruence among taxa is strongly scale dependent owing to differences in the relative contribution of large- and small-scale processes across taxa. Cross-taxon congruence in species composition is scale dependent only for its magnitude, because life-history traits of individual species make responses to environmental factors similar across scales. Forest monitoring should consider multi-taxon sampling and limit the use of surrogates at specific spatial scales, especially for species richness. Sampling plant species composition in scattered plots across different sites may effectively summarize the whole community composition. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Beta-diversity has been repeatedly shown to decline with increasing elevation, but the causes of this pattern remain unclear, partly because they are confounded by coincident variation in alpha- and gamma-diversity. We used 8795 forest vegetation-plot records from the Czech National Phytosociological Database to compare the observed patterns of beta diversity to null-model expectations (beta-deviation) controlling for the effects of alpha- and gamma-diversity. We tested whether β-diversity patterns along a 1200 m elevation gradient exclusively depend on the effect of varying species pool size, or also on the variation of the magnitude of community assembly mechanisms determining the distribution of species across communities (e.g. environmental filtering, dispersal limitation). The null model we used is a novel extension of an existing null-model designed for presence/absence data and was specifically designed to disrupt the effect of community assembly mechanisms, while retaining some key features of observed communities such as average species richness and species abundance distribution. Analyses were replicated in ten subregions with comparable elevation ranges. Beta-diversity declined along the elevation gradient due to a decrease in gamma-diversity, which was steeper than the decrease in alpha-diversity. This pattern persisted after controlling for alpha- and gamma-diversity variation, and the results were robust when different resampling schemes and diversity metrics were used. We conclude that in temperate forests the pattern of decreasing beta-diversity with elevation does not exclusively depend on variation in species pool size, as has been hypothesized, but also on variation in community assembly mechanisms. The results were consistent across resampling schemes and diversity measures, thus supporting the use of vegetation-plot databases for understanding patterns of beta-diversity at the regional scale. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Habitat loss is the primary cause of local extinctions. Yet, there is considerable uncertainty regarding how fast species respond to habitat loss, and how time-delayed responses vary in space. We focused on the Argentine Dry Chaco (c. 32 million ha), a global deforestation hotspot, and tested for time-delayed response of bird and mammal communities to landscape transformation. We quantified the magnitude of extinction debt by modelling contemporary species richness as a function of either contemporary or past (2000 and 1985) landscape patterns. We then used these models to map communities' extinction debt. We found strong evidence for an extinction debt: landscape structure from 2000 explained contemporary species richness of birds and mammals better than contemporary and 1985 landscapes. This suggests time-delayed responses between 10 and 25 years. Extinction debt was especially strong for forest specialists. Projecting our models across the Chaco highlighted areas where future local extinctions due to unpaid extinction debt are likely. Areas recently converted to agriculture had highest extinction debt, regardless of the post-conversion land use. Few local extinctions were predicted in areas with remaining larger forest patches. Synthesis and applications. The evidence for an unpaid extinction debt in the Argentine Dry Chaco provides a substantial window of opportunity for averting local biodiversity losses. However, this window may close rapidly if conservation activities such as habitat restoration are not implemented swiftly. Our extinction debt maps highlight areas where such conservation activities should be implemented. © 2018 The Authors. Journal of Applied Ecology © 2018 British Ecological Society},

To what extent do species richness and beta-diversity relate to forest structural attributes and heterogeneity?. Location: Five national parks in central and southern Italy. Methods: We sampled vascular plant species composition and forest structural attributes in eight unmanaged temperate mesic forest stands dominated or co-dominated by beech, and in eight comparison stands managed as high forests with similar environmental features. We compared plant species richness, composition and beta-diversity across pairs of stands (unmanaged vs managed) using GLMMs. Beta-diversity was quantified both at the scale of each pair of stands using plot-to-plot dissimilarity matrices (species turnover), and across the whole data set, considering the distance in the multivariate species space of individual plots from their centroid within the same stand (compositional heterogeneity). We modelled the relationship between species diversity (richness and beta-diversity) and forest structural heterogeneity and individual structural variables using GLMMs and multiple regression on distance matrices. Results: Species composition differed significantly between managed and unmanaged stands, but not richness and beta-diversity. We found weak evidence that plant species richness increased with increasing levels of structural heterogeneity and canopy diversification. At the scale of individual stands, species turnover was explained by different variables in distinct stands, with variables related to deadwood quantity and quality being selected most often. We did not find support for the hypothesis that compositional heterogeneity varies as a function of forest structural characteristics at the scale of the whole data set. Conclusions: Structurally complex unmanaged stands have a distinct herb layer species composition from that of mature stands in similar environmental conditions. Nevertheless, we did not find significantly higher levels of vascular plant species richness and beta-diversity in unmanaged stands. Beta-diversity was related to patterns of deadwood accumulation, while for species richness the evidence that it increases with increasing levels of canopy diversification was weak. These results suggest that emulating natural disturbance, and favouring deadwood accumulation and canopy diversification may benefit some, but not all, facets of plant species diversity in Apennine beech forests. © 2017 International Association for Vegetation Science},

abstract={Since adequate information on the distribution of biodiversity is hardly achievable, biodiversity indicators are necessary to support the management of ecosystems. These surrogates assume that either some habitat features, or the biodiversity patterns observed in a well-known taxon, can be used as a proxy of the diversity of one or more target taxa. Nevertheless, at least for certain taxa, the validity of this assumption has not yet been sufficiently demonstrated. We investigated the effectiveness of both a habitat- and a taxa-based surrogate in six European beech forests in the Apennines. Particularly, we tested: (1) whether the stand structural complexity and the herb-layer species richness were good predictors of the fine-scale patterns of species richness of five groups of forest-dwelling organisms (beetles, saproxylic and epigeous fungi, birds and epiphytic lichens); and (2) the cross-taxon congruence in species complementarity and composition between herb-layer plants and the target taxa. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs), accumulation curves and Procrustes analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of these surrogates when species richness, complementarity and composition were considered, respectively. Our results provided a limited support to the hypothesis that the herb-layer plants and the stand structural complexity were good surrogates of the target taxa. Although the richness of the herb-layer plants received a stronger support from the data than structural complexity as a predictor for the general patterns of species richness, the overall magnitude of this effect was weak and distinct taxa responded differently. For instance, for increasing levels of herb-layer richness, the richness of lichens showed a marked increase, while the richness of saproxylic fungi decreased. We also found significantly similar complementarity patterns between the herb-layer plants and beetles, as well as a significant congruence in species composition between herb-layer plants and saproxylic fungi. Finally, when different stand structural attributes were considered singularly, only the total amount of deadwood received support from the data as a predictor of the overall species richness. At the fine scale of this study, herb-layer plants and stand structural complexity did not prove to be effective surrogates of multi-taxon biodiversity in well-preserved southern European beech forests. Rather than on weak surrogates, these results suggest that sound conservation decisions should be supported by the information provided by comprehensive multi-taxonomic assessments of forest biodiversity. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={The extension of forest area is a globally accepted tool to offset CO2 emissions from deforestation and the combustion of fossil fuels. The common assumption is that in addition to the perceived climate benefits increasing forest area will also support biodiversity, thus making afforestation a “win-win scenario”. Based on the existing scientific evidences, we show that joined climate and biodiversity benefits are strongly context-dependent and that the outcome of afforestation is often highly questionable. In Europe, grasslands managed at low intensity contribute substantially to biodiversity conservation and carbon storage. However, many of these grasslands have been lost due to abandonment and subsequent spontaneous succession towards woody vegetation, or due to land use intensification. Moreover, grasslands are the ecosystems most often deliberately afforested in the context of EU carbon-centered policies that may thus counteract biodiversity conservation programmes. By reviewing the main EU policies targeting forests and grasslands, we found a striking ambivalence between policies and funding schemes addressing grassland conservation on the one hand (e.g. Habitats Directive, green payments within the Common Agricultural Policy) and those supporting afforestation on the other (e.g. rural development funds). We suggest three measures towards a better harmonization of the European Union policies that target forest and grassland ecosystems: (1) promoting the alignment of the decisions taken across different policy sectors; (2) focusing on the whole range of ecosystem services and biodiversity issues rather than on carbon management only; (3) valuing systems managed at low-intensity for their multifunctionality. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In recent decades, the European populations of wild boar have grown substantially, as has the impact of this species, owing above all to its rooting activity. Our aim was to investigate the relationships between vascular plant understorey and wild boar rooting intensity. The questions we addressed are: does rooting intensity influence understorey species composition and diversity? Which functional traits are associated with different levels of rooting? We performed a comparative analysis of plant communities in areas with contrasting levels of rooting intensity within a Mediterranean deciduous lowland forest in central Italy. Besides comparing species composition and diversity, we tested the association between species traits and rooting levels through fourth-corner analysis. We found that contrasting levels of rooting were associated to different understorey species composition and evenness, while we observed no significant difference in species richness. In contrast with our expectations, sites with lower rooting returned i) lower evenness values and ii) a higher proportion of species characterized by traits related to resistance or response to herbivory, i.e., spinescence, clonality, endozoochory, underground storage organs, and low height values. Our findings suggest that current vegetation patterns partly depend on the legacy effect of past rooting disturbance, since the areas currently subjected to low rooting intensity were likely to be intensely rooted in the past. These areas may have developed a marked dominance of clonal thorny species that, in turn, inhibited further feeding activities by wild boar. © 2015 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.},

abstract={Assessing the contribution of forest soils to carbon (C) and nutrient dynamics is extremely complex due to the high spatial variability of soil properties, at fine to very broad scales. Improving our understanding of soil variability is necessary to scale up sample-based inventory data for the estimation of regional contribution of forest soils to C dynamics. We analyzed the topsoil spatial variability of organic carbon (OC) and matter (OM), nitrogen (N), C/N ratio, texture, and pH in 11 southern European old-growth beech stands. Our aim was to assess the within- and among-stand topsoil variability, and to determine the drivers underlying this variation. For each stand, we sampled the topsoil in 25 quadrats in a 1-ha regular grid where we recorded overstorey structural and compositional attributes, deadwood quantity and quality, microtopography and site conditions. Soil parameters varied highly at both scales: When considering all the topsoil properties together through multivariate analysis, most of the variability occurred at the within-stand scale (mostly due to shifts in organic matter content, C/N, and litter depth); the opposite was true when considering soil properties singularly, with pH, soil texture, and N concentration varying greatly among stands. Most of the among-stand variability depended on climate and on the direct and indirect effects of parent material. Fine-scale variation, instead, depended mainly on overstorey composition and microtopographical variation. Surprisingly, we found no direct influence of overstorey structure on topsoil parameters, likely because soil parameters respond to changes in stand structural features only after a substantial time lag. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={A broad interest exists in developing structure-based indicators to use as proxies for other attributes that are difficult to assess, such as biological diversity. Summary variables that account for stand-scale forest structural complexity could facilitate the comparison among stands and provide a means of ranking stands in terms of their potential contribution to biodiversity. We developed an index of structural heterogeneity (SHI) for beech forests in southern Italy: (i) we established a preliminary list of 23 structural variables obtained from data routinely collected in forest inventories; (ii) we quantified these variables in a set of 64 beech-dominated stands encompassing a wide range of variability in the Cilento, Vallo di Diano and Alburni National Park; (iii) we identified a core set of attributes that take into account the main sources of structural heterogeneity identified in reference old-growth forests; and (iv) we combined these core attributes into a simple additive index (SHI). We identified eight core attributes that were rescaled to the range 0 to 10 using regression equations based on raw attribute data. The SHI was calculated as the sum of these attribute scores and then expressed as a percentage. The index performance was evaluated against ten reference old-growth beech stands in the Apennines. The index ranged between 38 and 79.1 (median=59.4) and was distributed normally for the calibration dataset. The SHI successfully discriminated between old-growth (range=71.9-99.9, median=85.1) and early-mature to mature forests. Furthermore, the SHI linearly increased with stand age and was higher in multi-layer high forests than in single- and double-layer forests. However, a large variation was detected within both management types and age classes. SHI could be helpful for foresters as a tool for quantifying and comparing structural heterogeneity before and after a silvicultural intervention aimed at restoring the structural complexity in second-growth stands. © SISEF.},

abstract={Different assembly processes may simultaneously affect local-scale variation of species composition in temperate old-growth forests. Ground layer species diversity reflects chance colonization and persistence of low-dispersal species, as well as fine-scale environmental heterogeneity. The latter depends on both purely abiotic factors, such as soil properties and topography, and factors primarily determined by overstorey structure, such as light availability. Understanding the degree to which plant diversity in old-growth forests is associated with structural heterogeneity and/or to dispersal limitation will help assessing the effectiveness of silvicultural practices that recreate old-growth patterns and structures for the conservation or restoration of plant diversity. We used a nested sampling design to assess fine-scale species turnover, i.e. the proportion of species composition that changes among sampling units, across 11 beech-dominated old-growth forests in Southern Europe. For each stand, we also measured a wide range of environmental and structural variables that might explain ground layer species turnover. Our aim was to quantify the relative importance of dispersal limitation in comparison to that of stand structural heterogeneity while controlling for other sources of environmental heterogeneity. For this purpose, we used multiple regression on distance matrices at the within-stand extent, and mixed effect models at the extent of the whole dataset. Species turnover was best predicted by structural and environmental heterogeneity, especially by differences in light availability and in topsoil nutrient concentration and texture. Spatial distances were significant only in four out of eleven stands with a relatively low explanatory power. This suggests that structural heterogeneity is a more important driver of local-scale ground layer species turnover than dispersal limitation in southern European old-growth beech forests. © 2014 Sabatini et al.},

abstract={The identification of the drivers of diversity in understorey plant assemblages is a major challenge in forest ecology. However, it is not yet fully understood whether the same factors consistently affect different facets of species organization, such as species richness, composition and turnover. Here, we compare the influence of fine-scale environmental variables and spatial organization on the herb-layer flora of two unmanaged and ecologically different forest stands in the Muniellos Biosphere Reserve, Northern Spain. The aims of our study are to identify the most important factors influencing different facets of herb-layer plant organization, and to test whether the effect of such drivers is consistent across facets and forest types. We used Generalized Linear Models, Redundancy Analysis and Multiple Regression on Distance Matrices to model, respectively, the response of species richness, species composition and species turnover to spatial distances as well as to several environmental factors, including forest structure, light conditions, soil and topographical features. We observed a substantial consistency among variables affecting the different facets of ground-layer species organization within stands, with a subset of topographical variables with a transversal effect across facets. Although potential solar radiation was the main variable influencing species richness in the two stands, the factors shaping species composition and turnover varied across forest types: in the beech stand, slope and canopy openness were the main determinants of herb-layer species diversity and turnover; in the oak stand, the main drivers of species composition were related to topography and spatial structure, while spatial distance was the main driver of species turnover. Our study shows that the ecological processes driving fine-scale variation of ground-layer plant richness and composition are similar to those driving species turnover. Although the ecological factors shaping different facets may be the same, we highlight that, at least in temperate forests, these factors are system-specific and vary according to forest types. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.},

abstract={Questions: Do ecological sorting processes and functional diversity of forest ground-layer plant communities vary among mature (65-85-yr-old) even-aged, managed uneven-aged and old-growth forest stands? How does functional diversity relate to environmental variables within stands? Location: Northern temperate deciduous forests of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA. Methods: Ground-layer species cover and light availability were measured at each of four old-growth, even-aged second-growth, and managed uneven-aged stands (n = 12 stands total). We used mixed-effect models and fourth-corner analysis to assess relationships among forest structure, species traits and the three components of functional diversity (functional richness, evenness, divergence) based on 32 leaf, reproductive and whole plant traits from 111 species. Results: We identified differences in leaf phenology and morphology, life form and dispersal among stand types at the community level. Ground-layer plant communities of even-aged and uneven-aged stands were at opposite ends of a spectrum of strategies aimed at tolerating stressful vs competitive environments, respectively. In even-aged stands, communities were characterized by species adapted to relatively dark and closed conditions (heavy-seeded tree saplings, spring ephemerals). In contrast, managed uneven-aged stands were characterized by species with potential for quick returns on investment of nutrients and dry mass in leaves (i.e. early summer species with high specific leaf area, low leaf dry matter content and high phosphorus concentration). Old-growth stands had fewer trait associations than managed stands, and were characterized by ferns and species with either ballistic or wind-assisted seed dispersal. Functional diversity metrics were related in complex ways to light, management and soil texture. Managed stands had higher functional richness and divergence than old-growth stands, which, instead, showed higher functional evenness. Conclusions: Even-aged and managed stands support ground-layer species with a distinct set of traits relative to those found in old-growth forests. Although there is broad interest in uneven-aged management as a means to restore the structures and functions of old-growth forests, uneven-aged management does not, at least initially, produce ground-layer plant communities more similar to old-growth forests than even-aged management. © 2013 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

abstract={Questions: What are the main drivers of variation in beta-diversity for Bromus erectus semi-natural dry grasslands of habitat 6210(*) at different scales? How should environmental variables and spatial patterns be taken into account to conserve the maximum possible beta-diversity within the habitat? Location: Central Italy. Methods: We used 195 vegetation relevés distributed in three nested extents: a single mountain, a mountain chain and southern Lazio. Multiple regression on distance matrices was performed using dissimilarity matrices based on: (1) species abundances as response variables; (2) spatial coordinates and environmental parameters (altitude, slope, percentage of rock and stone coverage, aspect, annual rainfall) as explanatory variables. The two groups of explanatory variables were used separately to partition the variation, and jointly to assess the relative contribution of each individual variable. Those variables found to significantly affect beta-diversity were used to: (1) compare beta-diversity levels between a set of randomly selected and a set of stratified relevés; and (2) analyse the habitat distribution across environmental gradients. These analyses, together with the curves describing the relationships between spatial distances and composition dissimilarities, were used to inform management decisions for the habitat. Results: Most of the variance was explained by environmental variables, whose share was higher in the smallest and intermediate extent than in the broadest extent. Community dissimilarity increased in proportion to differences in altitude and spatial distances at every extent. Accordingly, at all the extents, the selection of relevés stratified by altitude or selected taking into account a minimum spatial distance included significantly higher levels of within-habitat beta-diversity, than randomly selected relevés. The relation of beta-diversity to the variation in aspect and annual rainfall varied at different extents. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that dry grassland management plans aimed at conserving the maximum within-habitat beta-diversity should take into account variation in environmental variables, among which altitude proved to be a critical factor at every extent. Also, spatial distances positively affect within-habitat beta-diversity levels, and scale-dependent minimum distances among habitat patches should be taken into account when selecting patches of habitat 6210(*) to be conserved in the study area. © 2012 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

abstract={Temperate forests have been fundamentally altered by land use and other stressors globally; these have reduced the abundance of primary and old-growth forests in particular. Despite many regional studies, the literature lacks a global synthesis of temperate old-growth structural characteristics. In this study we compare literature derived data on mature and old-growth moist temperate forests with the aim of: (i) exploring global commonalities; (ii) investigating sources of variability among systems; and (iii) highlighting data gaps and research needs. We compiled a dataset of 147 records from 93 papers, and analyzed a set of structural indicators: basal area, stem density, large living trees, live aboveground biomass, quadratic mean diameter, and coarse woody debris volume. These indicators were contrasted between mature and old-growth age classes at a global level and across continents and broad forest types, testing for significance through Monte-Carlo permutation procedure. We also related structural indicators to age, climatic and geographical descriptors. Our results suggest that all structural indicators vary across systems in relation to geographical, compositional, and climatic influences. However old-growth forests showed global commonalities in structure when compared to mature forests: significantly higher densities of large living trees, higher quadratic mean diameter, and higher amounts of live aboveground biomass and coarse woody debris. Furthermore we found inconsistency in the structural variables reported by different papers; lack of studies on temperate forests in Russia, and Western and Central Asia. The findings improve our understanding of old-growth structure and function, and will help inform sustainable forest management and conservation approaches world-wide. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Tree species composition and stand structural complexity are valuable indicators of sustainable forest management. This article aims to investigate the relative influence of forest overstorey composition and structural attributes on understorey composition and diversity, taking into account also site characteristics and broad-scale environmental variables. We sampled vascular plant species composition and forest structure in 132 plots in the Cilento and Vallo di Diano National Park (southern Italy). Spearman's non-parametric correlation coefficients were calculated between overstorey and understorey diversity indices, beech percentage, and altitude and environmental indices. A complete partitioning of the variation in understorey composition was then performed through canonical correspondence analysis considering four sets of variables: (1) overstorey composition, (2) structural attributes, (3) topography, and (4) landscape abiotic variables. Finally, we constructed a regression tree analysis of understorey species richness using the same explanatory variables. Understorey diversity indices were positively correlated with overstorey diversity indices and with environmental indices (i. e., light and soil heterogeneity). Overstorey and understorey diversity indices were negatively correlated with both altitude and the dominance of beech in the overstorey. Compositional variation was due primarily to overstorey composition and secondarily to structural attributes. Regression tree analysis revealed that altitude, overstorey species richness, and structural attributes play an important role in determining understorey species richness. According to our results, understorey composition and diversity are strongly related to overstorey composition and structural attributes. Indeed, the latter proved to be effective indicators of understorey characteristics in the study area. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},
